                  draft-ietf-teas-5g-ns-ip-mpls-latest

Abstract

   Network slicing is a feature that was introduced by the 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in mobile networks.
   Realization of 5G slicing implies requirements for all mobile
   domains, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN),
   and Transport Network (TN).

   This document describes a Network Slice realization model for IP/MPLS
   networks with a focus on the Transport Network fulfilling 5G slicing
   connectivity service objectives.  The realization model reuses many
   building blocks currently commonly used in service provider networks.

1.  Introduction

   This document focuses on network slicing for 5G networks, covering
   the connectivity between Network Functions (NFs) across multiple
   domains such as edge clouds, data centers, and the Wide Area Network
   (WAN).  The document describes a Network Slice realization approach
   that fulfills 5G slicing requirements by using existing IP/MPLS
   technologies to optimally control connectivity Service Level
   Agreements (SLAs) offered for 5G slices.  To that aim, this document
   describes the scope of the Transport Network in 5G architectures
   (Section 3.1), disambiguates 5G Network Slicing versus Transport
   Network Slicing (Section 3.2), draws the perimeter of the various
   orchestration domains to realize slices (Section 3.4), and identifies
   the required coordination between these orchestration domains for
   adequate setup of Attachment Circuits (ACs) (Section 3.4.2).

   This work is compatible with the framework defined in [RFC9543] which
   describes network slicing in the context of networks built from IETF
   technologies.  Specifically, this document describes an approach to
   how RFC 9543 Network Slices are realized within provider networks and
   how such slices are stitched to Transport Network resources in a
   customer site in the context of Transport Network Slices (Figure 1).
   Concretely, the realization of an RFC 9543 Network Slice (i.e.,
   connectivity with performance commitments) involves the provider
   network and partially the AC (the PE-side of the AC).  This document
   assumes that the customer site infrastructure is over-provisioned and
   involves short distances (low latency) where basic QoS/scheduling
   logic is sufficient to comply with the Service Level Objectives
   (SLOs).

     Figure 1: Transport Network Slice & RFC 9543 Network Slice Scopes

   The realization approach described in this document is typically
   triggered by Network Slice Service requests.  How a Network Slice
   Service request is placed for realization, including how it is
   derived from a 5G Slice Service request, is out of scope.  Mapping
   considerations between 3GPP and IETF Network Slice Service (e.g.,
   mapping of service parameters) are discussed, e.g., in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-network-slice-application].

   The 5G control plane uses the Single Network Slice Selection
   Assistance Information (S-NSSAI) for slice identification
   [TS-23.501].  Because S-NSSAIs are not visible to the transport
   domain, 5G domains can expose the 5G slices to the transport domain
   by mapping to explicit data plane identifiers (e.g., Layer 2, Layer
   3, or Layer 4).  Passing information between customer sites and
   provider networks is referred to as the "hand-off".  Section 4 lists
   a set of hand-off methods for slice mapping purposes.

   The realization model described in this document uses a set of
   building blocks commonly used in service provider networks.
   Concretely, the model uses (1) Layer 2 Virtual Private Network
   (L2VPN) [RFC4664] and/or Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN)
   [RFC4364] service instances for logical separation, (2) fine-grained
   resource control at the Provider Edges (PEs), (3) coarse-grained
   resource control within the provider network, and (4) capacity
   planning/management.  More details are provided in Sections 3.7, 5,
   6, and 7.

   This realization model uses a single Network Resource Partition (NRP)
   (Section 7.1 of [RFC9543]).  The applicability to multiple NRPs is
   out of scope.

   Although this document focuses on 5G, the realizations are not
   fundamentally constrained by the 5G use case.  The document is not
   intended to be a BCP and does not claim to specify mandatory
   mechanisms to realize network slices.  Rather, a key goal of the
   document is to provide pragmatic implementation approaches by
   leveraging existing readily-available, widely-deployed techniques.
   The document is also intended to align the mobile and the IETF
   perspectives of slicing from a realization perspective.

   For a definitive description of 3GPP network architectures, the
   reader should refer to [TS-23.501].  More details can be found in
   [_5G-Book].

2.  Definitions

   The document uses the terms defined in [RFC9543].  Specifically, the
   use of "Customer" is consistent with [RFC9543] but with the following
   contextualization (see also Section 3.3):

   Customer:  An entity that is responsible for managing and
      orchestrating the end-to-end 5G Mobile Network, notably the Radio
      Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN).

      This entity is distinct from the customer of a 5G Network Slice
      Service.

   This document makes use of the following term:

   Customer site:  A customer manages and deploys 5G NFs (e.g., gNodeB
      (gNB) and 5G Core (5GC)) in customer sites.  A customer site can
      be either a physical or a virtual location.  A provider is
      responsible for interconnecting customer sites.

      Examples of customer sites are a customer private locations (Point
      of Presence (PoP), Data Center (DC)), a Virtual Private Cloud
      (VPC), or servers hosted within the provider network or colocation
      service.

   Resource Control:  In the context of this document, resource control
      is used mainly to refer to buffer management and relevant Quality
      of Service (QoS) functions.

   "5G Network Slicing" (or "5G Network Slice") refers to "Network
   Slicing" (or "Network Slice") as defined in the 3GPP [TS-28.530].

   An extended list of abbreviations used in this document is provided
   in Appendix B.

3.  5G Network Slicing Integration in Transport Networks

3.1.  Scope of the Transport Network

   The main 5G network building blocks are: the Radio Access Network
   (RAN), Core Network (CN), and Transport Network (TN).  The Transport
   Network is defined by the 3GPP as (Section 1 of [TS-28.530]):

   |  part supporting connectivity within and between CN and RAN parts.

   As discussed in Section 4.4.1 of [TS-28.530], the 3GPP management
   system does not directly control the Transport Network: it is
   considered as a non-3GPP managed system.

   |  The non-3GPP part includes TN parts.  The 3GPP management system
   |  provides the network slice requirements to the corresponding
   |  management systems of those non-3GPP parts, e.g. the TN part
   |  supports connectivity within and between CN and AN parts.

   In practice, the TN may not map to a monolithic architecture and
   management domain.  It is frequently segmented, non-uniform, and
   managed by different entities.  For example, Figure 2 depicts an NF
   instance that is deployed in an edge data center (DC) connected to an
   NF located in a Public Cloud via a WAN (e.g., MPLS-VPN service).  In
   this example, the TN can be seen as an abstraction representing an
   end-to-end connectivity based upon three distinct domains: DC, WAN,
   and Public Cloud.  A model for the Transport Network based on
   orchestration domains is introduced in Section 3.4.

3.2.  5G Network Slicing versus Transport Network Slicing

   Network slicing has a different meaning in the 3GPP mobile world and
   transport world.  This difference can be seen from the descriptions
   below that set out the objectives of 5G Network Slicing
   (Section 3.2.1) and Transport Network Slicing (Section 3.2.2).  These
   descriptions are not intended to be exhaustive.

3.2.1.  5G Network Slicing

   5G Network Slicing is defined by the 3GPP [TS-28.530] as an approach:

   |  where logical networks/partitions are created, with appropriate
   |  isolation, resources and optimized topology to serve a purpose or
   |  service category (e.g. use case/traffic category, or for MNO
   |  internal reasons) or customers (logical system created "on
   |  demand").

   These resources are from the TN, RAN, CN domains, and the underlying
   infrastructure.

   Section 3.1 of [TS-28.530] defines 5G Network Slice as:

   |  a logical network that provides specific network capabilities and
   |  network characteristics, supporting various service properties for
   |  network slice customers.

3.2.2.  Transport Network Slicing

   The term "TN slice" refers to a slice in the Transport Network domain
   of the 5G architecture.  The following further elaborates on how
   Transport Network Slicing is defined in the context of this document.
   It draws on the 3GPP definitions of Transport Network and Network
   Slicing as described in [TS-28.530].

   The objective of Transport Network Slicing is to isolate, guarantee,
   or prioritize Transport Network resources for Slice Services.
   Examples of such resources are: buffers, link capacity, or even
   Routing Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding Information Base (FIB).

   Transport Network Slicing provides various degrees of sharing of
   resources between slices (Section 8 of [RFC9543]).  For example, the
   network capacity can be shared by all slices, usually with a
   guaranteed minimum per slice, or each individual slice can be
   allocated dedicated network capacity.  Parts of a given network may
   use the former, while others use the latter.  For example, in order
   to satisfy local engineering guidelines and specific service
   requirements, shared TN resources could be provided in the backhaul
   (or midhaul), and dedicated TN resources could be provided in the
   midhaul (or backhaul).  The capacity partitioning strategy is
   deployment specific.

   There are different components to implement TN slices based upon
   mechanisms such as Virtual Routing and Forwarding instances (VRFs)
   for logical separation, QoS, and Traffic Engineering (TE).  Whether
   all or a subset of these components are enabled is a deployment
   choice.

3.3.  Transport Network Reference Design

   Figure 3 depicts the reference design used in this document for
   modeling the Transport Network based on management perimeters
   (Customer vs. Provider).

  Figure 3: Reference Design with Customer Site and Provider Network

   The description of the main components shown in Figure 3 is provided
   in the following subsections.

3.3.1.  Customer Site

   On top of 5G NFs, a customer may manage additional TN elements (e.g.,
   servers, routers, and switches) within a customer site.

   NFs may be hosted on a CE, directly connected to a CE, or be located
   multiple IP hops from a CE.

   The orchestration of the TN within a customer site involves a set of
   controllers for automation purposes (e.g., Network Functions
   Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), Container Network Interface
   (CNI), Fabric Managers, or Public Cloud APIs).  It is out of scope to
   document how these controllers are implemented.

3.3.2.  Customer Edge (CE)

   A CE is a function that provides logical connectivity of a customer
   site (Section 3.3.1) to the provider network (Section 3.3.3).  The
   logical connectivity is enforced at Layer 2 and/or Layer 3 and is
   denominated an Attachment Circuit (AC) (Section 3.3.5).  Examples of
   CEs include TN components (e.g., router, switch, and firewalls) and
   also 5G NFs (i.e., an element of the 5G domain such as Centralized
   Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), or User Plane Function (UPF)).

   A CE is typically managed by the customer, but it can also be co-
   managed with the provider.  A co-managed CE is orchestrated by both
   the customer and the provider.  In this case, the customer and
   provider usually have control on distinct device configuration
   perimeters.  A co-managed CE has both PE and CE functions and there
   is no strict AC connection, although one may consider that the AC
   stitching logic happens internally within the CE itself.  The
   provider manages the AC between the CE and the PE.

   This document generalizes the definition of a CE with the
   introduction of "Distributed CE"; that is, the logical connectivity
   is realized by configuring multiple devices in the customer domain.
   The CE function is distributed.  An example of distributed CE is the
   realization of an interconnection using a L3VPN service based on a
   distributed CE composed of a switch (Layer 2) and a router (Layer 3)
   (Figure 4).  Another example of distributed CE is shown in Figure 5.

                    Figure 4: Example of Distributed CE

   While in most cases CEs connect to PEs using IP (e.g., via Layer 3
   VLAN subinterfaces), a CE may also connect to the provider network
   using other technologies such as MPLS -potentially over IP tunnels-
   or Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8986].  The CE has thus
   awareness of provider services configuration (e.g., control plane
   identifiers such as Route Targets (RTs) and Route Distinguishers
   (RDs)).  However, the CE is still managed by the customer and the AC
   is based on MPLS or SRv6 data plane technologies.  The complete
   termination of the AC within the provider network may happen on
   distinct routers: this is another example of distributed PE.
   Service-aware CEs are used, for example, in the deployments discussed
   in Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.

3.3.3.  Provider Network

   A provider uses a provider network to interconnect customer sites.
   This document assumes that the provider network is based on IP, MPLS,
   or both.

3.3.4.  Provider Edge (PE)

   PE is a device managed by a provider that is connected to a CE.  The
   connectivity between a CE and a PE is achieved using one or multiple
   ACs (Section 3.3.5).

   This document generalizes the PE definition with the introduction of
   "Distributed PE"; that is, the logical connectivity is realized by
   configuring multiple devices in the provider network (i.e., provider
   orchestration domain).  The PE function is distributed.

   An example of a distributed PE is the "Managed CE service".  For
   example, a provider delivers VPN services using CEs and PEs which are
   both managed by the provider (case (i) in Figure 5).  The managed CE
   can also be a Data Center Gateway as depicted in the example (ii) of
   Figure 5.  A provider-managed CE may attach to CEs of multiple
   customers.  However, this device is part of the provider network.

   In subsequent sections of this document, the terms CE and PE are used
   for both single and distributed devices.

3.3.5.  Attachment Circuit (AC)

   The AC is the logical connection that attaches a CE (Section 3.3.2)
   to a PE (Section 3.3.4).  A CE is connected to a PE via one or
   multiple ACs.

   This document uses the concept of distributed CE and PE (Sections
   3.3.2 and 3.3.4) to consolidate a CE/AC/PE definition that is
   consistent with the orchestration perimeters (Section 3.4).  The CEs
   and PEs delimit respectively the customer and provider orchestration
   domains, while an AC interconnects these domains.

   For consistency with the AC data models terminology (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit] and
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit]), this document assumes that
   an AC is configured on a "bearer", which represents the underlying
   connectivity.  For example, the bearer is illustrated with "===" in
   Figures 4 and 5.

   An AC is technology-specific.  Examples of ACs are Virtual Local Area
   Networks (VLANs) (AC) configured on a physical interface (bearer) or
   an Overlay VXLAN EVI (AC) configured on an IP underlay (bearer).

   Deployment cases where the AC is also managed by the provider are not
   discussed in the document because the setup of such an AC does not
   require any coordination between the customer and provider
   orchestration domains.

      |  In order to keep the figures simple, only one AC and single-
      |  homed CEs are represented.  Also, the underlying bearers are
      |  not represented in most of the figures.  However, this document
      |  does not exclude the instantiation of multiple ACs between a CE
      |  and a PE nor the presence of CEs that are attached to more than
      |  one PE.

3.4.  Orchestration Overview

3.4.1.  5G End-to-End Slice Orchestration Architecture

   This section introduces a global framework for the orchestration of a
   5G end-to-end slice (a.k.a. 5G Network Slice) with a zoom on TN
   parts.  This framework helps to delimit the realization scope of RFC
   9543 Network Slices and identify interactions that are required for
   the realization of such slices.

   This framework is consistent with the management coordination example
   shown in Figure 4.7.1 of [TS-28.530].

   In reference to Figure 6, a 5G End-to-End Network Slice Orchestrator
   (5G NSO) is responsible for orchestrating 5G Network Slices end-to-
   end.  The details of the 5G NSO are out of the scope of this
   document.  The realization of the 5G Network Slices spans RAN, CN,
   and TN.  As mentioned in Section 3.1, the RAN and CN are under the
   responsibility of the 3GPP Management System, while the TN is not.
   The orchestration of the TN is split into two sub-domains in
   conformance with the reference design in Section 3.3:

   Provider Network Orchestration domain:  As defined in [RFC9543], the
      provider relies on a Network Slice Controller (NSC) to manage and
      orchestrate RFC 9543 Network Slices in the provider network.  This
      framework permits to manage connectivity together with SLOs.

   Customer Site Orchestration domain:  The Orchestration of TN elements
      of the customer sites relies upon a variety of controllers (e.g.,
      Fabric Manager, Element Management System, or Virtualized
      Infrastructure Manager (VIM)).

   A TN slice relies upon resources that can involve both the provider
   and customer TN domains.  More details are provided in Section 3.4.2.

   A TN slice might be considered as a variant of horizontal composition
   of Network Slices mentioned in Appendix A.6 of [RFC9543].

            Figure 6: 5G End-to-End Slice Orchestration with TN

   The various orchestration depicted in Figure 6 encompass the 3GPP's
   Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF) mentioned, e.g., in
   Figure 5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-network-slice-application].

3.4.2.  Transport Network Segments and Network Slice Instantiation

   This document focuses on RFC9543 Network Slice deployments where the
   Service Demarcation Points (SDPs) are located per Types 3 and 4 of
   Figure 1 of [RFC9543].  The concept of distributed PE (Section 3.3.4)
   assimilates CE-based SDPs defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC9543] (i.e.,
   Types 1 and 2) as SDP Type 3 or 4 in this document.

   In reference to the architecture depicted in Section 3.4.1, the
   connectivity between NFs can be decomposed into three main segment
   types:

   Customer Site:  Either connects NFs located in the same customer site
      or connects an NF to a CE.

      This segment may not be present if the NF is the CE.  In this case
      the AC connects the NF to a PE.

      The realization of this segment is driven by the 5G Network
      Orchestration (e.g., NFs instantiation) and the Customer Site
      Orchestration for the TN part.

   Provider Network:  Represents the connectivity between two PEs.  The
      realization of this segment is controlled by an NSC (Section 6.3
      of [RFC9543]).

   Attachment Circuit:  The orchestration of this segment relies
      partially upon an NSC for the configuration of the AC on the PE
      customer-facing interfaces and the Customer Site Orchestration for
      the configuration of the AC on the CE.

      PEs and CEs that are connected via an AC need to be provisioned
      with consistent data plane and control plane information (VLAN-
      IDs, IP addresses/subnets, BGP Autonomous System (AS) Number,
      etc.).  Hence, the realization of this interconnection is
      technology-specific and requires coordination between the Customer
      Site Orchestration and an NSC.  Automating the provisioning and
      management of the AC is thus key to automate the overall service
      provisioning.  Aligned with [RFC8969], this document assumes that
      this coordination is based upon standard YANG data models and
      APIs.

      The provisioning of a RFC9543 Network Slice may rely on new or
      existing ACs.

      Figure 7 is a basic example of a Layer 3 CE-PE link realization
      with shared network resources (such as VLAN-IDs and IP prefixes)
      which are passed between Orchestrators via a dedicated interface,
      e.g., the Network Slice Service Model (NSSM)
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] or the Attachment
      Circuit-as-a-Service (ACaaS)
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit].

3.5.  Mapping 5G Network Slices to Transport Network Slices

   There are multiple options for mapping 5G Network Slices to TN
   slices:

   *  1 to N: A single 5G Network Slice can be mapped to multiple TN
      slices (1 to N).  For instance, consider the scenario depicted in
      Figure 8, illustrating the separation of the 5G control plane and
      user plane in TN slices for a single 5G Enhanced Mobile Broadband
      (eMBB) network slice.  It is important to note that this mapping
      can serve as an interim step to M to N mapping.  Further details
      about this scheme are described in Section 3.6.

   *  M to 1: Multiple 5G Network Slices may rely upon the same TN
      slice.  In such a case, the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
      differentiation of slices would be entirely controlled at the 5G
      control plane, for example, with appropriate placement strategies:
      this use case is represented in Figure 9, where a User Plane
      Function (UPF) for the Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication
      (URLLC) slice is instantiated at the edge cloud close to the gNB
      Centralized Unit User Plane (CU-UP) for better latency/jitter
      control, while the 5G control plane and the UPF for eMBB slice are
      instantiated in the regional cloud.

   *  M to N: The 5G to TN slice mapping combines both approaches with a
      mix of shared and dedicated associations.

      In this scenario, a subset of the TN slices can be intended for
      sharing by multiple 5G Network Slices (e.g., the control plane TN
      slice is shared by multiple 5G network Slices).

      In practice, for operational and scaling reasons, typically M to N
      would be used, with M >> N.

               Figure 9: N (5G Slice) to 1 (TN Slice) Mapping

   Note that the actual realization of the mapping depends on several
   factors, such as the actual business cases, the NF vendor
   capabilities, the NF vendor reference designs, as well as service
   provider or even legal requirements.

   Mapping approaches that preserve the 5G slice identification in the
   TN (e.g., Section 4.2) may simplify required operations to map back
   TN slices to 5G slices.  However, such considerations are not
   detailed in this document because these are under the responsibility
   of the 3GPP orchestration domain.

3.6.  First 5G Slice versus Subsequent Slices

   An operational 5G Network Slice incorporates both 5G control plane
   and user plane capabilities.  For instance, in some deployments, in
   the case of a slice based on split-CU in the RAN, both CU-UP and
   Centralized Unit Control Plane (CU-CP) may need to be deployed along
   with the associated interfaces E1, F1-c, F1-u, N2, and N3 which are
   conveyed in the TN.  In this regard, the creation of the "first
   slice" can be subject to a specific logic that does not apply to
   subsequent slices.  Let us consider the example depicted in Figure 10
   to illustrate this deployment.  In this example, the first 5G slice
   relies on the deployment of NF-CP and NF-UP functions together with
   two TN slices for control and user planes (TNS-CP and TNS-UP1).
   Next, in many cases, the deployment of a second slice relies solely
   on the instantiation of a UPF (NF-UP2) together with a dedicated user
   plane TN slice (TNS-UP2).  The control plane of the first 5G slice is
   also updated to integrate the second slice: the TN slice (TNS-CP) and
   Network Functions (NF-CP) are shared.

      The model described here in which the control plane is shared
      among multiple slices is likely to be common; it is not mandatory,
      though.  Deployment models with a separate control plane for each
      slice are also possible.

   Section 6.1.2 of [NG.113] specifies that the eMBB slice (SST-1 and no
   Slice Differentiator (SD)) should be supported globally.  This 5G
   slice would be the first slice in any 5G deployment.

              Figure 10: First and Subsequent Slice Deployment

   TN slice mapping policies can be enforced by an operator (e.g.,
   provided to a TN Orchestration or 5G NSO) to instruct whether
   existing TN slices can be reused for handling a new slice service
   creation request.  Providing such a policy is meant to better
   automate the realization of 5G slices and minimize the realization
   delay that might be induced by extra cycles to seek for operator
   validation.

3.7.  Overview of the Transport Network Realization Model

   The realization model described in this document is depicted in
   Figure 11.  The following building blocks are used:

   *  L2VPN [RFC4664] and/or L3VPN [RFC4364] service instances for
      logical separation:

      This realization model of transport for 5G slices assumes Layer 3
      delivery for midhaul and backhaul transport connections, and a
      Layer 2 or Layer 3 delivery for fronthaul connections.  Enhanced
      Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) [ECPRI] supports both
      delivery models.  L2VPN/L3VPN service instances might be used as a
      basic form of logical slice separation.  Furthermore, using
      service instances results in an additional outer header (as
      packets are encapsulated/decapsulated at the nodes hosting service
      instances) providing clean discrimination between 5G QoS and TN
      QoS, as explained in Section 5.

      The use of VPNs for realizing Network Slices is briefly described
      in Appendix A.4 of [RFC9543].

   *  Fine-grained resource control at the PE:

      This is sometimes called 'admission control' or 'traffic
      conditioning'.  The main purpose is the enforcement of the
      bandwidth contract for the slice right at the edge of the provider
      network where the traffic is handed-off between the customer site
      and the provider network.

      The method used here is granular ingress policing (rate limiting)
      to enforce contracted bandwidths per slice and, potentially, per
      traffic class within the slice.  Traffic above the enforced rate
      might be immediately dropped, or marked as high drop-probability
      traffic, which is more likely to be dropped somewhere inside the
      provider network if congestion occurs.  In the egress direction at
      the PE node, hierarchical schedulers/shapers can be deployed,
      providing guaranteed rates per slice, as well as guarantees per
      traffic class within each slice.

      For managed CEs, edge admission control can be distributed between
      CEs and PEs, where a part of the admission control is implemented
      on the CE and other part of the admission control is implemented
      on the PE.

   *  Coarse-grained resource control at the transit (non-attachment
      circuits) links in the provider network, using a single NRP
      (called "base NRP" in Figure 11), spanning the entire provider
      network.  Transit nodes in the provider network do not maintain
      any state of individual slices.  Instead, only a flat (non-
      hierarchical) QoS model is used on transit links in the provider
      network, with up to 8 traffic classes.  At the PE, traffic-flows
      from multiple slice services are mapped to the limited number of
      traffic classes used on provider network transit links.

   *  Capacity planning/management for efficient usage of provider
      network resources:

      The role of capacity planning/management is to ensure the provider
      network capacity can be utilized without causing any bottlenecks.
      The methods used here can range from careful network planning, to
      ensure a more or less equal traffic distribution (i.e., equal cost
      load balancing), to advanced TE techniques, with or without
      bandwidth reservations, to force more consistent load distribution
      even in non-ECMP friendly network topologies.  See also Section 8
      of [RFC9522].

   This document does not describe in detail how to manage an L2VPN or
   L3VPN, as this is already well-documented.  For example, the reader
   may refer to [RFC4176] and [RFC6136] for such details.

4.  Hand-off Between Domains

   The 5G control plane relies upon 32-bit S-NSSAIs for slice
   identification.  The S-NSSAI is not visible to the transport domain.
   So instead, 5G network functions can expose the 5G slices to the
   transport domain by mapping to explicit Layer 2 or Layer 3
   identifiers, such as VLAN-IDs, IP addresses, or Differentiated
   Services Code Point (DSCP) values.  The following sections list few
   hand-off methods for slice mapping between customer sites and
   provider networks.

   More details about the mapping between 3GPP and RFC 9543 Network
   Slices is provided in [I-D.ietf-teas-5g-network-slice-application].


4.1.  VLAN Hand-off

   In this option, the RFC 9543 Network Slice, fulfilling connectivity
   requirements between NFs that belong to a 5G slice, is represented at
   an SDP by a VLAN ID (or double VLAN IDs, commonly known as QinQ), as
   depicted in Figure 12.

    + Logical interface represented by a VLAN on a physical interface
    * SDP

      Figure 12: Example of 5G Slice with VLAN Hand-off Providing End-
                            to-End Connectivity

   Each VLAN represents a distinct logical interface on the ACs; hence
   it provides the possibility to place these logical interfaces in
   distinct Layer 2 or Layer 3 service instances and implement
   separation between slices via service instances.  Since the 5G
   interfaces are IP-based interfaces (with an exception of the F2
   fronthaul-interface, where eCPRI with Ethernet encapsulation is
   used), this VLAN is typically not transported across the provider
   network.  Typically, it has only local significance at a particular
   SDP.  For simplification, a deployment may rely on the same VLAN
   identifier for all ACs.  However, that may not be always possible.
   As such, SDPs for a same slice at different locations may use
   different VLAN values.  Therefore, a VLAN to RFC 9543 Network Slice
   mapping table is maintained for each AC, and the VLAN allocation is
   coordinated between customer orchestration and provider
   orchestration.

   While VLAN hand-off is simple for NFs, it adds complexity at the
   provider network because of the requirement of maintaining mapping
   tables for each SDP and performing a configuration task for new VLANs
   and IP subnet for every slice on every AC.

4.2.  IP Hand-off

   In this option, an explicit mapping between source/destination IP
   addresses and slice's specific S-NSSAI is used.  The mapping can have
   either local (e.g., pertaining to single NF attachment) or global TN
   significance.  The mapping can be realized in multiple ways,
   including (but not limited to):

   *  S-NSSAI to a dedicated IP address for each NF

   *  S-NSSAI to a pool of IP addresses for global TN deployment

   *  S-NSSAI to a subset of bits of an IP address

   *  S-NSSAI to a DSCP value

   *  Use a deterministic algorithm to map S-NSAAI to an IP subnet,
      prefix, or pools.  For example, adaptations to the algorithm
      defined in [RFC7422] may be considered.

   Mapping S-NSSAIs to IP addresses makes IP addresses an identifier for
   slice-related policy enforcement in the Transport Network (e.g.,
   Differentiated Services, traffic steering, bandwidth allocation,
   security policies, or monitoring).

   One example of the IP hand-off realization is the arrangement, where
   the slices in the TN domain are instantiated using IP tunnels (e.g.,
   IPsec or GTP-U tunnels) established between NFs, as depicted in
   Figure 13.  The transport for a single 5G slice might be constructed
   with multiple such tunnels, since a typical 5G slice contains many
   NFs - especially DUs and CUs.  If a shared NF (i.e., an NF that
   serves multiple slices, for example, a shared DU) is deployed,
   multiple tunnels from shared NF are established, each tunnel
   representing a single slice.

                                           Tunnels representing slices

    Figure 13: Example of 5G Slice with IP Hand-off Providing End-to-End
                                Connectivity

   As opposed to the VLAN hand-off case (Section 4.1), there is no
   logical interface representing a slice on the PE, hence all slices
   are handled within a single service instance.  The IP and VLAN hand-
   offs are not mutually exclusive, but instead could be used
   concurrently.  Since the TN doesn't recognize S-NSSAIs, a mapping
   table similar to the VLAN Hand-off solution is needed (Section 4.1).

   The mapping table can be simplified if, for example, IPv6 addressing
   is used to address NFs.  An IPv6 address is a 128-bit long field,
   while the S-NSSAI is a 32-bit field: Slice/Service Type (SST): 8
   bits, Slice Differentiator (SD): 24 bits. 32 bits, out of 128 bits of
   the IPv6 address, may be used to encode the S-NSSAI, which makes an
   IP to Slice mapping table unnecessary.

   The S-NSSAI/IPv6 mapping is a local IPv6 address allocation method to
   NFs not disclosed to on-path nodes.  IP forwarding is not altered by
   this method and is still achieved following BCP 198 [RFC7608].
   Concretely, intermediary TN nodes are not required to associate any
   additional semantic with IPv6 address.

   However, operators using such mapping methods should be aware of the
   implications of any change of S-NSSAI on the IPv6 addressing plans.
   For example, modifications of the S-NSSAIs in-use will require
   updating the IP addresses used by NFs involved in the associated
   slices.

   An Example of local IPv6 addressing plan for NFs is provided in
   Appendix A

4.3.  MPLS Label Hand-off

   In this option, the service instances representing different slices
   are created directly on the NF, or within the customer site hosting
   the NF, and attached to the provider network.  Therefore, the packet
   is encapsulated outside the provider network with MPLS encapsulation
   or MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation [RFC7510], depending on the capability
   of the customer site, with the service label depicting the slice.

   There are three major methods (based upon Section 10 of [RFC4364])
   for interconnecting MPLS services over multiple service domains:

   Option A (Section 4.3.1):  VRF-to-VRF connections.

   Option B (Section 4.3.2):  redistribution of labeled VPN routes with
      next-hop change at domain boundaries.

   Option C (Section 4.3.3):  redistribution of labeled VPN routes
      without next-hop change and redistribution of labeled transport
      routes with next-hop change at domain boundaries.

   Figure 14 illustrates the use of service-aware CE (Section 3.3.2) for
   the deployment discussed in Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.

4.3.1.  Option A

   This option is not based on MPLS label hand-off, but VLAN hand-off,
   described in Section 4.1.

4.3.2.  Option B

   In this option, L3VPN service instances are instantiated outside the
   provider network.  These L3VPN service instances are instantiated in
   the customer site which could be, for example, either on the compute
   that hosts mobile NFs (Figure 15, left hand side) or within the DC/
   cloud infrastructure itself (e.g., on the top of the rack or leaf
   switch within cloud IP fabric (Figure 15, right hand side)).  On the
   AC connected to a PE, packets are already MPLS encapsulated (or MPLS-
   in-UDP/MPLS-in-IP encapsulated, if cloud or compute infrastructure
   don't support MPLS encapsulation).  Therefore, the PE uses neither a
   VLAN nor an IP address for slice identification at the SDP, but
   instead uses the MPLS label.

   MPLS labels are allocated dynamically in Option B deployments, where
   at the domain boundaries service prefixes are reflected with next-hop
   self, and a new label is dynamically allocated, as visible in
   Figure 15 (e.g., labels A, A', and A" for the first depicted slice).
   Therefore, for any slice-specific per-hop behavior at the provider
   network edge, the PE needs to determine which label represents which
   slice.  In the BGP control plane, when exchanging service prefixes
   over an AC, each slice might be represented by a unique BGP
   community, so tracking label assignment to the slice might be
   possible.  For example, in Figure 15, for the slice identified with
   COM-1, the PE advertises a dynamically allocated label A".  Since,
   based on the community, the label to slice association is known, the
   PE can use this dynamically allocated label A" to identify incoming
   packets as belonging to "slice 1" and execute appropriate edge per-
   hop behavior.

   It is worth noting that slice identification in the BGP control plane
   might be with per-prefix granularity.  In the extreme case, each
   prefix can have different community representing a different slice.
   Depending on the business requirements, each slice could be
   represented by a different service instance as outlined in Figure 15.
   In that case, the route target extended community (Section 4 of
   [RFC4360]) might be used as slice differentiator.  In other
   deployments, all prefixes (representing different slices) might be
   handled by a single 'mobile' service instance, and some other BGP
   attribute (e.g., a standard community [RFC1997]) might be used for
   slice differentiation.  There could be also a deployment option that
   groups multiple slices together into a single service instance,
   resulting in a handful of service instances.  In any case, fine-
   grained per-hop behavior at the edge of provider network is possible.

4.3.3.  Option C

   Option B relies upon exchanging service prefixes between customer
   sites and the provider network.  This may lead to scaling challenges
   in large scale 5G deployments as the PE node needs to carry all
   service prefixes.  To alleviate this scaling challenge, in Option C,
   service prefixes are exchanged between customer sites only.  In doing
   so, the provider network is offloaded from carrying, propagating, and
   programing appropriate forwarding entries for service prefixes.

   Option C relies upon exchanging service prefixes via multi-hop BGP
   sessions between customer sites, without changing the NEXT_HOP BGP
   attribute.  Additionally, IPv4/IPv6 labeled unicast (SAFI-4) host
   routes, used as NEXT_HOP for service prefixes, are exchanged via
   direct single-hop BGP sessions between adjacent nodes in a customer
   site and a provider network, as depicted in Figure 16.  As a result,
   a node in a customer site performs hierarchical next-hop resolution.

   This architecture requires an end-to-end Label Switched Path (LSP)
   leading from a packet's ingress node inside one customer site to its
   egress inside another customer site, through a provider network.
   Hence, at the domain (customer site, provider network) boundaries
   NEXT_HOP attribute for IPv4/IPv6 labeled unicast needs to be modified
   to "next-hop self" (nhs), which results in new IPv4/IPv6 labeled
   unicast label allocation.  Appropriate label swap forwarding entries
   for IPv4/IPv6 labeled unicast labels are programmed in the data
   plane.  There is no additional 'labeled transport' protocol on the AC
   (e.g., no LDP, RSVP, or SR).

   Packets are transmitted over the AC with the IPv4/IPv6 labeled
   unicast as the top label, with service label deeper in the label
   stack.  In Option C, the service label is not used for forwarding
   lookup on the PE.  This significantly lowers the scaling pressure on
   PEs, as PEs need to program forwarding entries only for IPv4/IPv6
   labeled unicast host routes, used as NEXT_HOP for service prefixes.
   Also, since one IPv4/IPv6 labeled unicast host route represent one
   customer site, regardless of the number of slices in the customer
   site, the number of forwarding entries on a PE is considerably
   reduced.

   For any slice-specific per-hop behavior at the provider network edge,
   as described in details in Section 3.7, the PE need to determine
   which label in the packet represents which slice.  This can be
   achieved, for example, by allocating non-overlapping service label
   ranges for each slice, and use these ranges for slice identification
   purposes on PE.

5.  QoS Mapping Realization Models

5.1.  QoS Layers

   The resources are managed via various QoS policies deployed in the
   network.  QoS mapping models to support 5G slicing connectivity
   implemented over packet switched provider network uses two layers of
   QoS that are discussed in Section 5.1.

5.1.1.  5G QoS Layer

   QoS treatment is indicated in the 5G QoS layer by the 5G QoS
   Indicator (5QI), as defined in [TS-23.501].  A 5QI is an identifier
   that is used as a reference to 5G QoS characteristics (e.g.,
   scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management
   thresholds, and link layer protocol configuration) in the RAN domain.
   Given that 5QI applies to the RAN domain, it is not visible to the
   provider network.  Therefore, if 5QI-aware treatment is desired in
   the provider network as well, 5G network functions might set DSCP
   with a value representing 5QI so that differentiated treatment can
   implemented in the provider network as well.  Based on these DSCP
   values, at SDP of each provider network segment used to construct
   transport for given 5G slice, very granular QoS enforcement might be
   implemented.

   The exact mapping between 5QI and DSCP is out of scope for this
   document.  Mapping recommendations are documented, e.g., in
   [I-D.cbs-teas-5qi-to-dscp-mapping].

   Each slice service might have flows with multiple 5QIs. 5QIs (or,
   more precisely, corresponding DSCP values) are visible to the
   provider network at SDPs (i.e., at the edge of the provider network).

   In this document, this layer of QoS is referred to as '5G QoS Class'
   ('5G QoS' in short) or '5G DSCP'.

5.1.2.  TN QoS Layer

   Control of the TN resources on provider network transit links, as
   well as traffic scheduling/prioritization on provider network transit
   links, is based on a flat (non-hierarchical) QoS model in this
   Network Slice realization.  That is, RFC 9543 Network Slices are
   assigned dedicated resources (e.g., QoS queues) at the edge of the
   provider network (at SDPs), while all RFC 9543 Network Slices are
   sharing resources (sharing QoS queues) on the transit links of the
   provider network.  Typical router hardware can support up to 8
   traffic queues per port, therefore the document assumes 8 traffic
   queues per port support in general.

   At this layer, QoS treatment is indicated by a QoS indicator specific
   to the encapsulation used in the provider network.  Such an indicator
   may be DSCP or MPLS Traffic Class (TC).  This layer of QoS is
   referred to as 'TN QoS Class', or 'TN QoS' for short, in this
   document.

5.2.  QoS Realization Models

   While 5QI might be exposed to the provider network via the DSCP value
   (corresponding to specific 5QI value) set in the IP packet generated
   by NFs, some 5G deployments might use 5QI in the RAN domain only,
   without requesting per-5QI differentiated treatment from the provider
   network.  This might be due to an NF limitation (e.g., no capability
   to set DSCP), or it might simply depend on the overall slicing
   deployment model.  The O-RAN Alliance, for example, defines a phased
   approach to the slicing, with initial phases utilizing only per-
   slice, but not per-5QI, differentiated treatment in the TN domain
   (Annex F of [O-RAN.WG9.XPSAAS]).

   Therefore, from a QoS perspective, the 5G slicing connectivity
   realization defines two high-level realization models for slicing in
   the TN domain: a 5QI-unaware model and a 5QI- aware model.  Both
   slicing models in the TN domain could be used concurrently within the
   same 5G slice.  For example, the TN segment for 5G midhaul (F1-U
   interface) might be 5QI-aware, while at the same time the TN segment
   for 5G backhaul (N3 interface) might follow the 5QI-unaware model.

   These models are further elaborated in the following two subsections.

5.2.1.  5QI-unaware Model

   In 5QI-unaware mode, the DSCP values in the packets received from NF
   at SDP are ignored.  In the provider network, there is no QoS
   differentiation at the 5G QoS Class level.  The entire RFC 9543
   Network Slice is mapped to a single TN QoS Class, and, therefore, to
   a single QoS queue on the routers in the provider network.  With a
   small number of deployed 5G slices (for example, only two 5G slices:
   eMBB and MIoT), it is possible to dedicate a separate QoS queue for
   each slice on transit routers in the provider network.  However, with
   the introduction of private/enterprises slices, as the number of 5G
   slices (and thus corresponding RFC 9543 Network Slices) increases, a
   single QoS queue on transit links in the provider network serves
   multiple slices with similar characteristics.  QoS enforcement on
   transit links is fully coarse-grained (single NRP, sharing resources
   among all RFC 9543 Network Slices), as displayed in Figure 17.

   When the IP traffic is handed over at the SDP from the AC to the
   provider network, the PE encapsulates the traffic into MPLS (if MPLS
   transport is used in the provider network), or IPv6 - optionally with
   some additional headers (if SRv6 transport is used in the provider
   network), and sends out the packets on the provider network transit
   link.

   The original IP header retains the DCSP marking (which is ignored in
   5QI-unaware model), while the new header (MPLS or IPv6) carries QoS
   marking (MPLS Traffic Class bits for MPLS encapsulation, or DSCP for
   SRv6/IPv6 encapsulation) related to TN Class of Service (CoS).  Based
   on TN CoS marking, per-hop behavior for all RFC 9543 Network Slices
   is executed on provider network transit links.  Provider network
   transit routers do not evaluate the original IP header for QoS-
   related decisions.  This model is outlined in Figure 18 for MPLS
   encapsulation, and in Figure 19 for SRv6 encapsulation.

   From a QoS perspective, both options are similar.  However, there is
   one difference between the two options.  The MPLS TC is only 3 bits
   (8 possible combinations), while DSCP is 6 bits (64 possible
   combinations).  Hence, SRv6 provides more flexibility for TN CoS
   design, especially in combination with soft policing with in-profile/
   out-profile traffic, as discussed in Section 5.2.1.1.

   Provider network edge resources are controlled in a granular, fine-
   grained manner, with dedicated resource allocation for each RFC 9543
   Network Slice.  The resource control/enforcement happens at each SDP
   in two directions: inbound and outbound.

5.2.1.1.  Inbound Edge Resource Control

   The main aspect of inbound provider network edge resource control is
   per-slice traffic volume enforcement.  This kind of enforcement is
   often called 'admission control' or 'traffic conditioning'.  The goal
   of this inbound enforcement is to ensure that the traffic above the
   contracted rate is dropped or deprioritized, depending on the
   business rules, right at the edge of provider network.  This,
   combined with appropriate network capacity planning/management
   (Section 7) is required to ensure proper isolation between slices in
   a scalable manner.  As a result, traffic of one slice has no
   influence on the traffic of other slices, even if the slice is
   misbehaving (e.g., Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks or
   node/link failures) and generates traffic volumes above the
   contracted rates.

   The slice rates can be characterized with following parameters
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang]:

   *  CIR: Committed Information Rate (i.e., guaranteed bandwidth)

   *  PIR: Peak Information Rate (i.e., maximum bandwidth)

   These parameters define the traffic characteristics of the slice and
   are part of SLO parameter set provided by the 5G NSO to an NSC.
   Based on these parameters, the provider network's inbound policy can
   be implemented using one of following options:

   *  1r2c (single-rate two-color) rate limiter

      This is the most basic rate limiter, described in Section 2.3 of
      [RFC2475].  It meters at the SDP a traffic stream of given slice
      and marks its packets as in-profile (below CIR being enforced) or
      out-of-profile (above CIR being enforced).  In-profile packets are
      accepted and forwarded.  Out-of profile packets are either dropped
      right at the SDP (hard rate limiting), or remarked (with different
      MPLS TC or DSCP TN markings) to signify 'this packet should be
      dropped in the first place, if there is a congestion' (soft rate
      limiting), depending on the business policy of the provider
      network.  In the second case, while packets above CIR are
      forwarded at the SDP, they are subject to being dropped during any
      congestion event at any place in the provider network.

   *  2r3c (two-rate three-color) rate limiter

      This was initially defined in [RFC2698], and its improved version
      in [RFC4115].  In essence, the traffic is assigned to one of the
      these three categories:

      -  Green, for traffic under CIR

      -  Yellow, for traffic between CIR and PIR

      -  Red, for traffic above PIR

      An inbound 2r3c meter implemented with [RFC4115], compared to
      [RFC2698], is more 'customer friendly' as it doesn't impose
      outbound peak-rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE)
      devices. 2r3c meters in general give greater flexibility for
      provider network edge enforcement regarding accepting the traffic
      (green), de- prioritizing and potentially dropping the traffic on
      transit during congestion (yellow), or hard dropping the traffic
      (red).

   Inbound provider network edge enforcement model for 5QI-unaware
   model, where all packets belonging to the slice are treated the same
   way in the provider network (no 5Q QoS Class differentiation in the
   provider) is outlined in Figure 20.

       Figure 20: Ingress Slice Admission Control (5QI-unware Model)

5.2.1.2.  Outbound Edge Resource Control

   While inbound slice admission control at the provider network edge is
   mandatory in the architecture described in this document, outbound
   provider network edge resource control might not be required in all
   use cases.  Use cases that specifically call for outbound provider
   network edge resource control are:

   *  Slices use both CIR and PIR parameters, and provider network edge
      links (ACs) are dimensioned to fulfill the aggregate of slice
      CIRs.  If at any given time, some slices send the traffic above
      CIR, congestion in outbound direction on the provider network edge
      link (AC) might happen.  Therefore, fine-grained resource control
      to guarantee at least CIR for each slice is required.

   *  Any-to-Any (A2A) connectivity constructs are deployed, again
      resulting in potential congestion in outbound direction on the
      provider network edge links, even if only slice CIR parameters are
      used.  This again requires fine-grained resource control per slice
      in outbound direction at the provider network edge links.

   As opposed to inbound provider network edge resource control,
   typically implemented with rate-limiters/policers, outbound resource
   control is typically implemented with a weighted/priority queuing,
   potentially combined with optional shapers (per slice).  A detailed
   analysis of different queuing mechanisms is out of scope for this
   document, but is provided in [RFC7806].

   Figure 21 outlines the outbound provider network edge resource
   control model for 5QI-unaware slices.  Each slice is assigned a
   single egress queue.  The sum of slice CIRs, used as the weight in
   weighted queueing model, should not exceed the physical capacity of
   the AC.  Slice requests above this limit should be rejected by the
   NSC, unless an already established slice with lower priority, if such
   exists, is preempted.

   Given that in deployments with a large number of 5G slices, the
   number of potential 5G QoS Classes is much higher than the number of
   TN QoS Classes, multiple 5G QoS Classes with similar characteristics
   - potentially from different slices - would be grouped with common
   operator-defined TN logic and mapped to a same TN QoS Class when
   transported in the provider network.  That is, common Per-hop
   Behavior (PHB) [RFC2474] is executed on transit provider network
   routers for all packets grouped together.  An example of this
   approach is outlined in Figure 23.  A provider may decide to
   implement Diffserv-Intercon PHBs at the boundaries of its network
   domain [RFC8100].

   Note:  The numbers indicated in Figure 23 (S-NSSAI, 5QI, DSCP, queue,
      etc.) are provided for illustration purposes only and should not

              Figure 23: Example of 3GPP QoS Mapped to TN QoS

   In current SDO progress of 3GPP (Release 17) and O-RAN, the mapping
   of 5QI to DSCP is not expected to be in a per-slice fashion, where
   5QI to DSCP mapping may vary from 3GPP slice to 3GPP slice, hence the
   mapping of 5G QoS DSCP values to TN QoS Classes may be rather common.

   Like in the 5QI-unaware model, the original IP header retains the
   DCSP marking corresponding to 5QI (5G QoS Class), while the new
   header (MPLS or IPv6) carries QoS marking related to TN QoS Class.
   Based on TN QoS Class marking, per-hop behavior for all aggregated 5G
   QoS Classes from all RFC 9543 Network Slices is executed on the
   provider network transit links.  Provider network transit routers do
   not evaluate the original IP header for QoS related decisions.  The
   original DSCP marking retained in the original IP header is used at
   the PE for fine-grained per slice and per 5G QoS Class inbound/
   outbound enforcement on the AC.

   In the 5QI-aware model, compared to the 5QI-unware model, provider
   network edge resources are controlled in an even more granular, fine-
   grained manner, with dedicated resource allocation for each RFC 9543
   Network Slice and dedicated resource allocation for number of traffic
   classes (most commonly up 4 or 8 traffic classes, depending on the
   Hardware capability of the equipment) within each RFC 9543 Network
   Slice.

5.2.2.1.  Inbound Edge Resource Control

   Compared to the 5QI-unware model, admission control (traffic
   conditioning) in the 5QI-aware model is more granular, as it enforces
   not only per slice capacity constraints, but may as well enforce the
   constraints per 5G QoS Class within each slice.

   A 5G slice using multiple 5QIs can potentially specify rates in one
   of the following ways:

   *  Rates per traffic class (CIR or CIR+PIR), no rate per slice (sum
      of rates per class gives the rate per slice).

   *  Rate per slice (CIR or CIR+PIR), and rates per prioritized
      (premium) traffic classes (CIR only).  Best effort traffic class
      uses the bandwidth (within slice CIR/PIR) not consumed by
      prioritized classes.

   In the first option, the slice admission control is executed with
   traffic class granularity, as outlined in Figure 24.  In this model,
   if a premium class doesn't consume all available class capacity, it
   cannot be reused by non-premium (i.e., Best Effort) class.

        Figure 24: Ingress Slice Admission Control (5QI-aware Model)

   The second model combines the advantages of 5QI-unaware model (per
   slice admission control) with the per traffic class admission
   control, as outlined in Figure 24.  Ingress admission control is at
   class granularity for premium classes (CIR only).  Non-premium class
   (i.e., Best Effort) has no separate class admission control policy,
   but it is allowed to use the entire slice capacity, which is
   available at any given moment.  I.e., slice capacity, which is not
   consumed by premium classes.  It is a hierarchical model, as depicted
   in Figure 25.

5.2.2.2.  Outbound Edge Resource Control

   Figure 26 outlines the outbound edge resource control model at the
   transport network layer for 5QI-aware slices.  Each slice is assigned
   multiple egress queues.  The sum of queue weights, which are 5Q QoS
   queue CIRs within the slice, should not exceed the CIR of the slice
   itself.  And, similarly to the 5QI-aware model, the sum of slice CIRs
   should not exceed the physical capacity of the AC.

5.3.  Transit Resource Control

   Transit resource control is much simpler than Edge resource control
   in the provider network.  As outlined in Figure 22, at the provider
   network edge, 5Q QoS Class marking (represented by DSCP related to
   5QI set by mobile network functions in the packets handed off to the
   TN) is mapped to the TN QoS Class.  Based on TN QoS Class, when the
   packet is encapsulated with outer header (MPLS or IPv6), TN QoS Class
   marking (MPLS TC or IPv6 DSCP in outer header, as depicted in Figures
   18 and 19) is set in the outer header.  PHB in provider network
   transit routers is based exclusively on that TN QoS Class marking,
   i.e., original 5G QoS Class DSCP is not taken into consideration on
   transit.

   Provider network transit resource control does not use any inbound
   interface policy, but only outbound interface policy, which is based
   on priority queue combined with weighted or deficit queuing model,
   without any shaper.  The main purpose of transit resource control is
   to ensure that during network congestion events, for example caused
   by network failures and temporary rerouting, premium classes are
   prioritized, and any drops only occur in traffic that was de-
   prioritized by ingress admission control Section 5.2.1.1 or in non-
   premium (best-effort) classes.  Capacity planning and management, as
   described in Section 7, ensures that enough capacity is available to
   fulfill all approved slice requests.

6.  PE Underlay Transport Mapping Models

   The PE underlay transport (underlay transport, for short) refers to a
   specific path forwarding behavior between PEs in order to provide
   packet delivery that is consistent with the corresponding SLOs.  This
   realization step focuses on controlling the paths that will be used
   for packet delivery between PEs, independent of the underlying
   network resource partitioning.

   It is worth noting that TN QoS Classes and underlay transport are
   each related to different engineering objectives.  The TN domain can
   be operated with, e.g., 8 TN QoS Classes (representing 8 hardware
   queues in the routers), and two underlay transports (e.g., latency
   optimized underlay transport using link latency metrics for path
   calculation, and underlay transport following Interior Gateway
   Protocol (IGP) metrics).  TN QoS Class determines the per-hop
   behavior when the packets are transiting through the provider
   network, while underlay transport determines the paths for packets
   through provider network based on the operator's requirements.  This
   path can be optimized or constrained.

   A network operator can define multiple underlay transports within a
   single NRP.  An underlay transport may be realized in multiple ways
   such as (but not limited to):

   *  A mesh of RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or SR-TE [RFC9256] tunnels created
      with specific optimization criteria and constraints.  For example,
      mesh "A" might represent tunnels optimized for latency, and mesh
      "B" might represent tunnels optimized for high capacity.

   *  A Flex-Algorithm [RFC9350] with a particular metric-type (e.g.,
      latency), or one that only uses links with particular properties
      (e.g., MACsec link [IEEE802.1AE]), or excludes links that are
      within a particular geography.

   These protocols can be controlled, e.g., by tuning the protocol list
   under the "underlay-transport" data node defined in the L3VPN Network
   Model (L3NM) [RFC9182] and the L2VPN Network Model (L2NM) [RFC9291].

   Also, underlay transports may be realized using separate NRPs.
   However, such an approach is left out of the scope given the current
   state of the technology (2024).

   Similar to the QoS mapping models discussed in Section 5, for mapping
   to underlay transports at the ingress PE, both 5QI-unaware and 5QI-
   aware models are defined.  Essentially, entire slices can be mapped
   to underlay transports without 5G QoS consideration (5QI-unaware
   model).  For example, flows with different 5G QoS Classes, even from
   same slice, can be mapped to different underlay transports (5QI-aware
   model).

   Figure 27 depicts an example of a simple network with two underlay
   transports, each using a mesh of TE tunnels with or without Path
   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC5440], and with or without per-path
   bandwidth reservations.  Section 7 discusses in detail different
   bandwidth models that can be deployed in the provider network.
   However, discussion about how to realize or orchestrate underlay
   transports is out of scope for this document.

       Figure 27: Example of Underlay Transport Relying on TE Tunnels

   For illustration purposes, Figure 27 shows only single tunnels per
   underlay transport for (ingress PE, egress PE) pair.  However, there
   might be multiple tunnels within a single underlay transport between
   any pair of PEs.

6.1.  5QI-unaware Model

   As discussed in Section 5.2.1, in the 5QI-unware model, the provider
   network doesn't take into account 5G QoS during execution of per-hop
   behavior.  The entire slice is mapped to single TN QoS Class,
   therefore the entire slice is subject to the same per-hop behavior.
   Similarly, in 5QI-unaware PE underlay transport mapping model, the
   entire slice is mapped to a single underlay transport, as depicted in
   Figure 28.

   In 5QI-aware model, the traffic can be mapped to underlay transports
   at the granularity of 5G QoS Class.  Given that the potential number
   of underlay transports is limited, packets from multiple 5G QoS
   Classes with similar characteristics are mapped to a common underlay

7.1.  Bandwidth Requirements

   This section describes the information conveyed by the 5G NSO to the
   NSC with respect to slice bandwidth requirements.

   Figure 30 shows three DCs that contain instances of network
   functions.  Also shown are PEs that have links to the DCs.  The PEs
   belong to the provider network.  Other details of the provider
   network, such as P-routers and transit links are not shown.  Also
   details of the DC infrastructure in customer sites, such as switches
   and routers, are not shown.

   The 5G NSO is aware of the existence of the network functions and
   their locations.  However, it is not aware of the details of the
   provider network.  The NSC has the opposite view - it is aware of the
   provider network infrastructure and the links between the PEs and the
   DCs, but is not aware of the individual network functions at customer
   sites.

     * SDP, with fine-grained QoS (dedicated resources per RFC 9543 NS)

               Figure 30: An Example of Multi-DC Architecture

   Let us consider 5G slice "X" that uses some of the network functions
   in the three DCs.  If this slice has latency requirements, the 5G NSO
   will have taken those into account when deciding which NF instances
   in which DC are to be invoked for this slice.  As a result of such a
   placement decision, the three DCs shown are involved in 5G slice "X",
   rather than other DCs.  For its decision-making, the 5G NSO needs
   information from the NSC about the observed latency between DCs.
   Preferably, the NSC would present the topology in an abstracted form,
   consisting of point-to-point abstracted links between pairs of DCs
   and associated latency and, optionally, delay variation and link loss
   values.  It would be valuable to have a mechanism for the 5G NSO to
   inform the NSC which DC-pairs are of interest for these metrics -
   there may be of order thousands of DCs, but the 5G NSO will only be
   interested in these metrics for a small fraction of all the possible
   DC-pairs, i.e. those in the same region of the provider network.  The
   mechanism for conveying the information is out of scope for this
   document.

   Table 1 shows the matrix of bandwidth demands for 5G slice "X".
   Within the slice, multiple NF instances might be sending traffic from
   DCi to DCj.  However, the 5G NSO sums the associated demands into one
   value.  For example, "NF1A" and "NF1B" in "DC1" might be sending
   traffic to multiple NFs in "DC2", but this is expressed as one value
   in the traffic matrix: the total bandwidth required for 5G slice "X"
   from "DC1" to "DC2" (8 units).  Each row in the right-most column in
   the traffic matrix shows the total amount of traffic going from a
   given DC into the transport network, regardless of the destination
   DC.  Note that this number can be less than the sum of DC-to-DC
   demands in the same row, on the basis that not all the NFs are likely
   to be sending at their maximum rate simultaneously.  For example, the
   total traffic from "DC1" for slice "X" is 11 units, which is less
   than the sum of the DC-to-DC demands in the same row (13 units).
   Note, as described in Section 5, a slice may have per-QoS class
   bandwidth requirements, and may have CIR and PIR limits.  This is not
   included in the example, but the same principles apply in such cases.

             | DC 3    | 4    | 7    | n/a  |      10.0     |
             +---------+------+------+------+---------------+

                 Table 1: Inter-DC Traffic Demand Matrix
                                (Slice X)

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] can be used to convey all
   of the information in the traffic matrix to an NSC.  The NSC applies
   policers corresponding to the last column in the traffic matrix to
   the appropriate PE routers, in order to enforce the bandwidth
   contract.  For example, it applies a policer of 11 units to PE1A and
   PE1B that face DC1, as this is the total bandwidth that DC1 sends
   into the provider network corresponding to Slice X.  Also, the
   controller may apply shapers in the direction from the TN to the DC,
   if otherwise there is the possibility of a link in the DC being
   oversubscribed.  Note that a peer NF endpoint of an AC can be
   identified using 'peer-sap-id' as defined in [RFC9408].

   Depending on the bandwidth model used in the provider network
   (Section 7.2), the other values in the matrix, i.e., the DC-to-DC
   demands, may not be directly applied to the provider network.  Even
   so, the information may be useful to the NSC for capacity planning
   and failure simulation purposes.  If, on the other hand, the DC-to-DC
   demand information is not used by the NSC, the IETF YANG Data Model
   for L3VPN Service Delivery [RFC8299] or the IETF YANG Data Model for
   L2VPN Service Delivery [RFC8466] could be used instead of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang], as they support
   conveying the bandwidth information in the right-most column of the
   traffic matrix.

   The provider network may be implemented in such a way that it has
   various types of paths, for example low-latency traffic might be
   mapped onto a different transport path to other traffic (for example
   a particular Flex-Algorithm, a particular set of TE paths, or a
   specific queue [RFC9330]), as discussed in Section 5.  The 5G NSO can
   use [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] to request low-
   latency transport for a given slice if required.  However, [RFC8299]
   or [RFC8466] do not support requesting a particular transport-type,
   e.g., low-latency.  One option is to augment these models to convey
   this information.  This can be achieved by reusing the 'underlay-
   transport' construct defined in [RFC9182] and [RFC9291].

7.2.  Bandwidth Models

   This section describes three bandwidth management schemes that could
   be employed in the provider network.  Many variations are possible,
   but each example describes the salient points of the corresponding
   scheme.  Schemes 2 and 3 use TE; other variations on TE are possible
   as described in [RFC9522].

7.2.1.  Scheme 1: Shortest Path Forwarding (SPF)

   Shortest path forwarding is used according to the IGP metric.  Given
   that some slices are likely to have latency SLOs, the IGP metric on
   each link can be set to be in proportion to the latency of the link.
   In this way, all traffic follows the minimum latency path between
   endpoints.

   In Scheme 1, although the operator provides bandwidth guarantees to
   the slice customers, there is no explicit end-to-end underpinning of
   the bandwidth SLO, in the form of bandwidth reservations across the
   provider network.  Rather, the expected performance is achieved via
   capacity planning, based on traffic growth trends and anticipated
   future demands, in order to ensure that network links are not over-
   subscribed.  This scheme is analogous to that used in many existing
   business VPN deployments, in that bandwidth guarantees are provided
   to the customers but are not explicitly underpinned end to end across
   the provider network.

   A variation on the scheme is that Flex-Algorithm [RFC9350] is used.
   For example, one Flex-Algorithm could use latency-based metrics and
   another Flex-Algorithm could use the IGP metric.  There would be a
   many-to-one mapping of Network Slices to Flex-Algorithms.

   While Scheme 1 is technically feasible, it is vulnerable to
   unexpected changes in traffic patterns and/or network element
   failures resulting in congestion.  This is because, unlike Schemes 2
   and 3 which employ TE, traffic cannot be diverted from the shortest
   path.

7.2.2.  Scheme 2: TE Paths with Fixed Bandwidth Reservations

   Scheme 2 uses RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or SR-TE paths [RFC9256] with fixed
   bandwidth reservations.  By "fixed", we mean a value that stays
   constant over time, unless the 5G NSO communicates a change in slice
   bandwidth requirements, due to the creation or modification of a
   slice.  Note that the "reservations" may be maintained by the
   transport controller - it is not necessary (or indeed possible for
   current SR-TE technology in 2024) to reserve bandwidth at the network
   layer.  The bandwidth requirement acts as a constraint whenever the
   controller (re)computes a path.  There could be a single mesh of
   paths between endpoints that carry all of the traffic types, or there
   could be a small handful of meshes, for example one mesh for low-
   latency traffic that follows the minimum latency path and another
   mesh for the other traffic that follows the minimum IGP metric path,
   as described in Section 5.  There would be a many-to-one mapping of
   slices to paths.

   The bandwidth requirement from DCi to DCj is the sum of the DCi-DCj
   demands of the individual slices.  For example, if only slices "X"
   and "Y" are present, then the bandwidth requirement from "DC1" to
   "DC2" is 12 units (8 units for slice "X" (Table 1) and 4 units for
   slice "Y" (Table 2)).  When the 5G NSO requests a new slice, the NSC,
   increments the bandwidth requirement according to the requirements of
   the new slice.  For example, in Figure 30, suppose a new slice is
   instantiated that needs 0.8 Gbps from "DC1" to "DC2".  The transport
   controller would increase its notion of the bandwidth requirement
   from "DC1" to "DC2" from 12 Gbps to 12.8 Gbps to accommodate the
   additional expected traffic.

             +=========+======+======+======+===============+
             | From/To | DC 1 | DC 2 | DC 3 | Total from DC |
             +=========+======+======+======+===============+
             | DC 1    | n/a  | 4    | 2.5  |      6.0      |
             +---------+------+------+------+---------------+
             | DC 2    | 0.5  | n/a  | 0.8  |      1.0      |
             +---------+------+------+------+---------------+
             | DC 3    | 2.6  | 3    | n/a  |      5.1      |
             +---------+------+------+------+---------------+

                 Table 2: Inter-DC Traffic Demand Matrix
                                (Slice Y)

   In the example, each DC has two PEs facing it for reasons of
   resilience.  The NSC needs to determine how to map the "DC1" to "DC2"
   bandwidth requirement to bandwidth reservations of TE LSPs from "DC1"
   to "DC2".  For example, if the routing configuration is arranged such
   that in the absence of any network failure, traffic from "DC1" to
   "DC2" always enters "PE1A" and goes to "PE2A", the controller
   reserves 12.8 Gbps of bandwidth on the path from "PE1A" to "PE2A".
   If, on the other hand, the routing configuration is arranged such
   that in the absence of any network failure, traffic from "DC1" to
   "DC2" always enters "PE1A" and is load-balanced across "PE2A" and
   "PE2B", the controller reserves 6.4 Gbps of bandwidth on the path
   from "PE1A" to "PE2A" and 6.4 Gbps of bandwidth on the path from
   "PE1A" to "PE2B".  It might be tricky for the NSC to be aware of all
   conditions that change the way traffic lands on the various PEs, and
   therefore know that it needs to change bandwidth reservations of
   paths accordingly.  For example, there might be an internal failure
   within "DC1" that causes traffic from "DC1" to land on "PE1B", rather
   than "PE1A".  The NSC may not be aware of the failure and therefore
   may not know that it now needs to apply bandwidth reservations to
   paths from "PE1B" to "PE2A" / "PE2B".

7.2.3.  Scheme 3: TE Paths without Bandwidth Reservation

   Like Scheme 2, Scheme 3 uses RSVP-TE or SR-TE paths.  There could be
   a single mesh of paths between endpoints that carry all of the
   traffic types, or there could be a small handful of meshes, for
   example one mesh for low-latency traffic that follows the minimum
   latency path and another mesh for the other traffic that follows the
   minimum IGP metric path, as described in Section 5.  There would be a
   many-to-one mapping of slices to paths.

   The difference between Scheme 2 and Scheme 3 is that Scheme 3 does
   not have fixed bandwidth reservations for the paths.  Instead, actual
   measured data-plane traffic volumes are used to influence the
   placement of TE paths.  One way of achieving this is to use
   distributed RSVP-TE with auto-bandwidth.  Alternatively, the NSC can
   use telemetry-driven automatic congestion avoidance.  In this
   approach, when the actual traffic volume in the data plane on given
   link exceeds a threshold, the controller, knowing how much actual
   data plane traffic is currently traveling along each RSVP or SR-TE
   path, can tune the paths of one or more paths using the link such
   that they avoid that link.  This approach is similar to that
   described in Section 4.3.1 of [RFC9522].

   It would be undesirable to move a path that has latency as its cost
   function, rather than another type of path, in order to ease the
   congestion, as the altered path will typically have a higher latency.
   This can be avoided by designing the algorithms described in the
   previous paragraph such that they avoid moving minimum-latency paths
   unless there is no alternative.

8.  Network Slicing OAM

   The deployment and maintenance of slices within a network imply that
   a set of OAM functions ([RFC6291]) need to be deployed by the
   providers, e.g.:

   *  Providers should be able to execute OAM tasks on a per Network
      Slice basis.  These tasks can cover the "full" slice within a
      domain or a portion of that slice (for troubleshooting purposes,
      for example).

      For example, per-slice OAM tasks can consist of (but not limited
      to):

      -  tracing resources that are bound to a given Network Slice,

      -  tracing resources that are invoked when forwarding a given flow
         bound to a given Network Slice,

      -  assessing whether flow isolation characteristics are in
         conformance with the Network Slice Service requirements, or

      -  assessing the compliance of the allocated Network Slice
         resources against flow/ customer service requirements.

      [RFC7276] provides an overview of available OAM tools.  These
      technology-specific tools can be reused in the context of network
      slicing.  Providers that deploy network slicing capabilities
      should be able to select whatever OAM technology or specific
      feature that would address their needs.

   *  Providers may want to enable differentiated failure detect and
      repair features for a subset of network slices.  For example, a
      given Network Slice may require fast detect and repair mechanisms,
      while others may not be engineered with such means.  The provider
      can use techniques such as [RFC5286], [RFC5714], or [RFC8355].

   *  Providers may deploy means to dynamically discover the set of
      Network Slices that are enabled within its network.  Such dynamic
      discovery capability facilitates the detection of any mismatch
      between the view maintained by the control/management plane and
      the actual network configuration.  When mismatches are detected,
      corrective actions should be undertaken accordingly.  For example,
      a provider may rely upon the L3NM [RFC9182] or the L2NM [RFC9291]
      to maintain the full set of L3VPN/L2VPNs that are used to deliver
      Network Slice Services.  The correlation between an LxVPN instance
      and a Network Slice Service is maintained using "parent-service-
      id" attribute (Section 7.3 of [RFC9182]).

   *  Means to report a set of network performance metrics to assess
      whether the agreed slice service objectives are honored.  These
      means are used for SLO monitoring and violation detect purposes.
      For example, [RFC9375] can be used to report links' one-way delay,
      one-way delay variation, etc.  Both conventional active/passive
      measurement methods [RFC7799] and more recent telemetry methods
      (e.g., YANG Push [RFC8641]) can be used.

   *  Means to report and expose observed performance metrics and other
      OAM state to customer.  For example,
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] exposes a set of
      statistics per SDP, connectivity construct, and connection group.

9.  Scalability Implications

   The mapping between 5G slice to TN slices (see Section 3.5) is a
   design choice of service operators that may be a function of, e.g.,
   the number of instantiated slices, requested services, or local
   engineering capabilities and guidelines.  However, operators should
   carefully consider means to ease slice migration strategies.  For
   example, a provider may initially adopt a 1-to-1 mapping if it has to
   instantiate just a few Network Slices and accommodate the need of
   only a few customers.  That provider may decide to move to a N-to-1
   mapping for aggregation/scalability purposes if sustained increased
   slice demand is observed.

   Putting in place adequate automation means to realize Network Slices
   (including the adjustment of Slice Services to Network Slices
   mapping) would ease slice migration operations.

   The realization model described in the document inherits the
   scalability properties of the underlying L2VPN and L3VPN technologies
   (Section 3.7).  Readers may refer, for example, to Section 13 of
   [RFC4365] or Section 1.2.5 of [RFC6624] for a scalability assessment
   of some of these technologies.  Providers may adjust the mapping
   model to better handle local scalability constraints.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any IANA request.

11.  Security Considerations

   Section 10 of [RFC9543] discusses generic security considerations
   that are applicable to network slicing, with a focus on the following
   considerations:

   *  Conformance to security constraints:

      Specific security requests, such as not routing traffic through a
      particular geographical region can be met by mapping the traffic
      to an underlay transport that avoids that region.

   *  IETF NSC authentication:

      This is out of the scope for this document.  It should be
      addressed in documents that describe IETF NSC realization (e.g.,
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ns-controller-models]).

   *  Specific isolation criteria:

      Adequate admission control policies, for example policers as
      described in Section 5.2.1.1, should be configured in the edge of
      the provider network to control access to specific slice
      resources.  This prevents the possibility of one slice consuming
      resources at the expense of other slices.  Likewise, access to
      classification and mapping tables have to be controlled to prevent
      misbehaviors (an unauthorized entity may modify the table to bind
      traffic to a random slice, redirect the traffic, etc.).  Network
      devices have to check that a required access privilege is provided
      before granting access to specific data or performing specific
      actions.

   *  Data Confidentiality and Integrity of an IETF Network Slice:

      As described in Section 5.1.2.1 of [RFC9543], the customer might
      request an SLE that mandates encryption.  As described in
      Section 6, this can be achieved, e.g., by mapping the traffic to
      an underlay transport that uses only MACsec-encrypted links.

   Many of the YANG modules cited in this document define schema for
   data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   In order to avoid the need for a mapping table to associate source/
   destination IP addresses and slices' specific S-NSSAIs, Section 4.2
   describes an approach where some or all S-NSSAI bits are embedded in
   an IPv6 address using an algorithm approach.  An attacker from within
   the transport network who has access to the mapping configuration may
   infer the slices to which belong a packet.  It may also alter these
   bits which may lead to steering the packet via a distinct network
   slice, and thus lead to service disruption.  Note that such an on-
   path attacker may make more damage (e.g., randomly drop packets).

   Security considerations specific to each of the technologies and
   protocols listed in the document are discussed in the specification
   documents of each of these protocols.

Appendix A.  An Example of Local IPv6 Addressing Plan for Network
             Functions

   Different IPv6 address allocation schemes following the above
   approach may be used, with one example allocation shown in Figure 31.

                  <------------------128 bits------------->

                   tt     - SST (8 bits)
                   dddddd - SD (24 bits)

       Figure 31: An Example of S-NSSAI Embedded into an IPv6 Address

   In reference to Figure 31, the most significant 96 bits of the IPv6
   address are unique to the NF, but do not carry any slice-specific
   information.  The S-NSSAI information is embedded in the least
   significant 32 bits.  The 96-bit part of the address may be
   structured by the provider, for example, on the geographical location
   or the DC identification.  Refer to Section 2.1. of [RFC9099] for a
   discussion on the benefits of structuring an address plan around both
   services and geographic locations for more structured security
   policies in a network.

   Figure 32 uses the example from Figure 31 to demonstrate a slicing
   deployment, where the entire S-NSSAI is embedded into IPv6 addresses
   used by NFs.  Let us consider that "NF-A" has a set of tunnel
   termination points with unique per-slice IP addresses allocated from
   2001:db8:a:0::/96, while "NF-B" uses a set of tunnel termination
   points with per-slice IP addresses allocated from 2001:db8:b:0::/96.
   This example shows two slices: "customer A eMBB" (SST-01, SD-00001)
   and "customer B Massive Internet of Things (MIoT)" (SST-03, SD-
   00003).  For "customer A eMBB" slice, the tunnel IP addresses are
   auto-derived as the IP addresses {2001:db8:a::100:1,
   2001:db8:b::100:1}, where {:0100:0001} is used as the last two
   octets. "customer B MIoT" slice (SST-3, SD-00003) tunnel uses the IP
   addresses {2001:db8:a::300:3, 2001:db8:b::300:3} and simply adds
   {:0300:0003} as the last two octets.  Leading zeros are not
   represented in the resulting IPv6 addresses as per [RFC5952].
